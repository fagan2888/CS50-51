    "For this assignment, you will craft arguments in favor of each side of a *would you rather* question. You must then analyze the arguments in full, making strong applications of all of the logical thinking HCs. The arguments can be as simple or as sophisticated as you wish! Keep in mind that more complicated arguments will require a richer, more careful analysis. This may be a good way to showcase your knowledge, but could also lead to more flaws. Moreover, in pursuit of the appropriate difficulty level, you’ll notice several *Optional* problems throughout the assignment to challenge yourself. These will only be scored if they are completed correctly with thorough explanation. If you attempt an optional challenge but do not succeed, you will not be penalized with a low score.\n",

It should be an occasion for #selfawareness and #professionalism. *However, since footnotes are not possible in Jupyter notebooks, simply provide the hashtag of the HC and a 1-3 sentence explanation of your application in a Markdown cell*. Help the professor understand exactly why this constitutes a strong application. For guidelines on how to integrate HCs in your work and write meaningful footnotes, please see [this guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7yOVOtMIaHQdKLeRmZbq1gRqwJKfezBsfru9Q6PcHw/edit?usp=sharing), “Addressing HCs in your work,” particularly section 3.

The code from lesson 2.2 may also be helpful. Either way, you need to include clearly annotated comments to explain what the code is doing and how it is using logic. Read this [resource](https://mikegrouchy.com/blog/yes-your-code-does-need-comments) about the importance of comments and [this one](https://realpython.com/python-comments-guide/) for further guidance. You should include in-line comments as well as a holistic explanation of the code. In particular, you should explain how the truth table is used to ascertain validity and how this logic concept is incorporated in the code. You are not required to print the full truth table, but it may provide you with a helpful sanity check. "

We could correct this by making a strong appeal to authority. For example: The concensus among neurologists is that short-term memory is more important than long-term memory, therefore short-term memory is preferable to long-term memory. This is a significant change to the premises but it is needed to correct it. The conclusion does not change"
