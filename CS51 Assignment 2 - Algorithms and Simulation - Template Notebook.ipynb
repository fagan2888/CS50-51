    "# CS51 Assignment 2: Algorithms and Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment has two distinct parts in addition to a reflection: Part 1 requires you to apply your knowledge of algorithmic thinking and optimization and Part 2 allows you to demonstrate your modeling and coding skills by writing a numerical simulation. Material relevant for Part 1 will be covered in class during weeks 3-5, while material relevant for Part 2 will be covered in class during weeks 7 and 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice several \"*Optional Challenge*\" problems throughout the assignment to challenge yourself. These will only be scored (4 or 5) if they are completed correctly with thorough explanation. If you attempt an optional challenge but do not succeed, you will not be penalized with a low score. Remember that you must include an explanation and interpretation for optional problems to be scored.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is an individual assignment. We will be checking for similarities among submissions and will take plagiarism seriously*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FORMAT\n",
    "\n",
    "For optimal formatting, please use [Markdown and Code cells appropriately](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RHoHCt_yWjOu7pGSCgPnLMJqY5H-w8Uf/view?usp=sharing) (more tips in this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGNPV_1.1.3/dsx/markd-jupyter.html)) and ensure ALL components of your work (including written analysis, images, tables, and code) are presented professionally. Anything marked as optional will only be scored if it is completed correctly. *Tip to avoid grammar and spelling errors*: do your writing using a program that is compatible with Grammarly, then copy your work into the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HC GUIDELINES\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be graded on the targeted HCs (#algorithms, #optimization, #modeling, #dataviz, #variables, #selfawareness) as indicated above in square brackets, at the discretion of the professor. \"Footnotes\" for these targeted HCs are not required. Please refer to the rubrics and your class notes as guidelines for these HCs. The optional challenges will only be given extra HC scores (4s or 5s) for correct and well-explained implementations that demonstrate deep knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you believe that you have strong applications of other HCs, such as #estimation or #utility, please call this out. Doing so is an important part of reflecting on your learning. It should be an occasion for #selfawareness and #professionalism. However, since footnotes are not possible in Jupyter notebooks, simply provide the hashtag of the HC and a 1-3 sentence explanation of your application in a Markdown cell. Help the professor understand exactly why this constitutes a strong application. For guidelines on how to integrate HCs in your work and write meaningful footnotes, please see this guide, [Addressing HCs in your work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s7yOVOtMIaHQdKLeRmZbq1gRqwJKfezBsfru9Q6PcHw/edit?usp=sharing), particularly section 3. For more samples of effective annotations, refer to the footnotes that go along with each HC example in the Outcome Index, written in square brackets.\n"

    "1. *Scenario 1*: To prevent the spread of an infectious disease, a vaccine needs to be distributed as quickly and efficiently as possible to the 15 cities that have had major outbreaks. How can you optimize the route between the cities? For this scenario, you should select cities that are relevant to the disease that you will choose for PART 2 and include a map of these cities (you may use an existing map or draw your own). \n",
    "\n",

    "2. *Scenario 2*: Suppose that a new virus is starting to spread, and many clinics do not have sophisticated diagnostic tools and must be able to determine whether or not a patient has this dangerous virus based solely on easily measured symptoms. You have been collecting information on symptoms (temperature, WBC count, headache severity, and cough severity) and you need to determine which patients have this new disease and which have only a milder illness.

Identify and describe an existing algorithm that could be used to complete this process, including the inputs, outputs, and required steps. Name at least one other optimization technique that could be applied in this scenario and justify why you selected the technique you chose.

    "I used a decision tree to classify patients into sick and not sick. I divided the dataset into training and test (using the traditional 80/20 split). This algorithm uses Gini splitting. In order to prevent overfitting, I required the tree to have a minimum of 4 sample to create a split. Other optimization algorithms that can be used incude logistical regression and k-means clustering. I chose to go with a decision tree because it works well with a small amount of data and it is very easy to understand how it works, since we can visualize the tree. An optimization tree only finds the local optimum, because it only chooses one option for each split without considering how accurate the other possibilities will be when additional splits are added."

    "The algorithm managed to get 100% accuracy in classifiying people (weirdly enough, sometimes the same model predicts one the datapoint differently and gets 95%. It manages to correctly classify all people in the test dataset to sick and not sick. This looks impressive, but we must take into account that: 1. Our test dataset is small, and thus the test accuracy has big uncertainty. In fact, with different seeds we get very different accuracies 2. Any biases in the dataset will be carried on to the algorithm. For example, if most infected patients in the dataset are men, and men have slightly lower body temperature, the algorithm might use that false indicator to determine who is sick or not. We want our dataset to be as broad and representative as possible."

    "I selected to model COVID-19 (described as \"Wuhan\" in the spreadsheet, somewhat outdatedly). Since COVID has a significant incubation period, I added a terms to the equations to represent individuals who are infected but cannot yet spread the disease, called exposed. Since the disease is very new, estimating parameters is difficult. To deduce beta and lambda, I will use R0 estimates and the beta given is the spreadsheet to calculate recovery. While I do not believe there is evidence supporting that beta, I did not manage to find reliable data. Luckily, The R0 estimate is 3.28 (1) from [this](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jtm/taaa021/5735319#199702574) meta-analysis. Even if beta is not accurate, the final outcome should be the same, because I use R0 to calculate lambda, just the time scale will be different. Thus beta is 0.050065 and alpha = beta / R0 = 0.015264. The rate of exposed people becoming infected will be calculated as 1 / incubation period, which is equal to 5 (2). We will assume natural mortality rate is 0"

    "The SIR model is a set of differential equations, so solving them means getting a function that shows, for example, infected rate as a function of time. Since we cannot do that analytically, we are using the euler method, which provides us with estimated solutions. Thus the simulation is discrete while the mathematical model is continuous, because we break it into steps. The weakness of our approach is that errors in the solution compound when more steps are calculated. Its strengh is how simple it is"

    "This model shows that most people in the world will be infected with coronavirus in the next two months, with the infected population peaking at around day 42. When changing the starting configuration, a similar pattern is seen but the time for everyone to get infected can vary. A lower infection rate causes the population to stabilize at a higher susceptible percent and take longer to stabilize, and if it is below the recovery rate the infection dies out. The incubation period only appears to slow the progression of the disease and heighten the equilibrium point by a bit. This model does not take into account efforts to fight coronavirus, prospective vaccines, geographical barriers, climate variation, etc. so it should not be taken too seriously"

    "Since the parameters of the NetLogo model are more abstract, they require more guessing. Recovery rate is the inverse of the mortality rate, estimated to be 2%. Right now around 2,500 out of 80,000 people are recovering each day in China (from [here](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/pzhgli/new_list.shtml)), so we will estimate recovery at 32 days or 5 week (rounding up because this is probably an underestimation because there haven't been many new infections so most of who is currently infected has been sick for some time). Since the model shows a rapid decline of the disease using this configuration, which does not fit real-world behavior, infectiousness will be set to the max, 99%. Population size is set to max (300), also to more closely match real world behavior"

    "These results show that coronavirus will infect around 21.7% of people (factoring in dead people), and will continue to around 20 weeks before dying out. This actually seems like a reasonable estimation, but I don't think it is for the right reasons. The things stopping coronavirus are quarantines and countermeasures. without those we will see much more infected people. The model does not seem to be able to have a high enough infection rate to accurately model the disease. There are still many real-world limitations to the model."

    "The SEIR simulation got a much more pessimistic outcome than the agent-based model. While I believe Netlogo has closer results to what will actually happen, it has them for the wrong reasons. In this case, agent-based modelling is practically almost identical to the SIR model, since we can derive the same equations from it, only with stochastic elements (SIR and SEIR are deterministic) and slightly different input parameters. For example, the rate of people infected is equal to the number of infected people times number of susceptible people times infectiousness in the Netlogo model too. This means the SEIR model is clearer (no unnessecary levels of complexity) and closer to the real world (because it has the exposed number)."
